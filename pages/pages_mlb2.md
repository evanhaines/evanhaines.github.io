# MLB Pitcher Injury Prediction & Analysis

Tools Used - Python <br />
Methodologies Used - Dogisitic Regression \| Data Visualization \| XGBoost \| Data Cleaning \| Decision Trees \| Machine Learning \| Data Wrangling

#### Project Purpose - Can we use machine learning techniques to accurately predict MLB pitcher injuries based on player performance data 

This was my final project for my BAIS 6060 Data Science course. I pulled pitcher injury information, pitcher-level data, and pitch-level data from various sources using selenium and Data Wrangling Techniques. After scraping the data, I performed extenisce data cleaning 



ata Programming with R course. My team and I pulled out pitch level and pitcher level data from Statcast (Baseball Savant.com) into our Rstudio file. We performed extensive data cleaning to ensure our data was able to be pushed through our machine learning models.

We then used traditional Data Preprocessing techniques by scaling the numerical data, one hot encoding categorical variables, and using train/validation/test splits our machine learning models. After creating numerous data visualizations and using testing metics like ROC AUC, precision, recall, etc. to evaluate the performance of these models, we composed a final report and presentation. After a successful presentation to the class, my group and I received both an A on the project and in the class. Unfortunately, I am unable to include our code as it was done on our university's private server, but our final presentation is included below
