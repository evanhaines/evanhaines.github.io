# MLB Pitcher Injury Prediction & Analysis

Tools Used - Python <br />
Methodologies Used - Dogisitic Regression \| Data Visualization \| XGBoost \| Data Cleaning \| Decision Trees \| Machine Learning \| Data Wrangling

#### Project Purpose - Can we use machine learning techniques to accurately predict MLB pitcher injuries based on player performance data 

This was my final project for my BAIS 6060 Data Science course. I pulled pitcher injury information, pitcher-level data, and pitch-level data from various sources using selenium and Data Wrangling Techniques. After scraping the data, I performed extensive data cleaning by doing everything from column name mapping to column addition, horizontal integration, missing value handling, etc. I used traditional Data Preprocessing techniques by scaling the numerical data, one hot encoding categorical variables, and using train/validation/test splits for our machine learning models.

I then created 3 machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost) for our classification prediction. After using various testing metrics like ROC AUC, precision, recall, etc. I determined that the XGBoost model performed the best and was able to predict pitcher injuries for both the current and future seasons with reasonable accuracy. Lastly, I used various data visualization techniques to create different charts and graphs, for my final summary and presentation.
