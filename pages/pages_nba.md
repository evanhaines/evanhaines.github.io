# Travel Schedules Impact on NBA Player Performance

Tools Used - Python <br />
Methodologies Used - Linear Regression Analysis \| Data Visualization \| XGBoost \| Random Forest \| ANOVA \| Data Cleaning \| Machine Learning

#### Project Purpose - Can we use machine learning techniques to accurately predict changes in indiviudal player performance based on aspects of their travel schedule?

This was my final project for my BAIS 3250 Data Wrangling Class. I utilized selenium to webscrape each NBA team's travel schedule for 2021 - 2024 seasons. I improted each player's game logs for each game played throughout these seasons through the NBA_stats API. I performed extensive data cleaning by doing everything from column name mapping, columns addition, horizontal integration, missing value handling, etc. 

I then created numerous statistical analysis models and machine learning models. Specifically I ran ANOVA hypothesis tests, llinear regression, XGboost regression, random forest regression, etc. I used various data visualization techniqiues to create different charts and graphs to present my findings.



NOTE - will fully finalize this page following the completetion of my project.
