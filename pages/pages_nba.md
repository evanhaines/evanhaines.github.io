# Travel Schedules Impact on NBA Player Performance

Tools Used - Python <br />
Methodologies Used - Linear Regression Analysis \| Data Visualization \| XGBoost \| Random Forest \| ANOVA \| Data Cleaning \| Machine Learning

#### Project Purpose - Can we use machine learning techniques to accurately predict changes in individual player performance based on aspects of their travel schedule?

This was my final project for my BAIS 3250 Data Wrangling Class. I utilized Selenium to web-scrape each NBA team's travel schedule for the 2021 - 2024 seasons. I imported each player's game logs for each game played throughout these seasons through the NBA_stats API. I performed extensive data cleaning by doing everything from column name mapping to column addition, horizontal integration, missing value handling, etc. 

I used traditional Data Preprocessing techniques by scaling the numerical data, one hot encoding categorical variables, and using train/validation/test splits for our machine learning models.

I then created numerous statistical analysis models and machine learning models. Specifically, I ran ANOVA hypothesis tests and created Logistic, Decision Tree, and XGBoost models. I used various testing metrics like ROC AUC, precision, recall, R^2, etc. to evaluate the performance of these models. Lastly, I used various data visualization techniques to create different charts and graphs, and wrote a professional final report to assess my findings.
