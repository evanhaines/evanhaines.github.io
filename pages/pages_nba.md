# Travel Schedules Impact on NBA Player Performance

Tools Used - Python <br />
Methodologies Used - Linear Regression Analysis \| Data Visualization \| XGBoost \| Random Forest \| ANOVA \| Data Cleaning \| Machine Learning

#### Project Purpose - Can we use machine learning techniques to accurately predict changes in individual player performance based on aspects of their travel schedule?

This was my final project for my BAIS 3250 Data Wrangling Class. I utilized Selenium to web-scrape each NBA team's travel schedule for the 2021 - 2024 seasons. I imported each player's game logs for each game played throughout these seasons through the NBA_stats API. I performed extensive data cleaning by doing everything from column name mapping to column addition, horizontal integration, missing value handling, etc. 

I then created numerous statistical analysis models and machine learning models. Specifically, I ran ANOVA hypothesis tests, linear regression, XGboost regression, random forest regression, etc. I used various data visualization techniques to create different charts and graphs to present my findings.



NOTE - I will fully finalize this page following the completion of my project.
