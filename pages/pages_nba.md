#### Problem Statement - 

This was my final project for my BAIS 3250 Data Wrangling Class. I utilized selenium to webscrape 

I utilized Excel to restructure and clean over 600 pieces of defensive statistical data gathered from each of the 32 NFL teams throughout the 2021 and 2022 NFL seasons. We also noted the end-of-regular-season power rankings for each team and set this to be the dependent variable within our analysis.

We then performed Liner Regression and Data Collinearity within Excel to identify significant independent variables. We extracted 10 unique variables and used p-values with an alpha value of 0.05 to find the most impactful variables with a 95% confidence interval. Through our analysis, we found the following variables to be the most impactful - Fumbles forced per game, interceptions forced per game, and rushing yards allowed per game. With our final data, we crafted various graphs and charts to visualize our findings and presented our work and solution to our TA.
