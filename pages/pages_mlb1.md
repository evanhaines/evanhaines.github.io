# MLB Umpire Pitch Call Analysis 

Tools Used - R <br />
Methodologies Used - Linear Regression Analysis \| Data Visualization \| XGBoost \| Data Cleaning \| Machine Learning

#### Project Purpose - Can we use machine learning techniques to accurately predict umpire strike calls based on pitch-level and pitcher-level statistics

This was my final project for my BAIS 6060 Data Programming with R course. My team and I pulled out pitch level and pitcher level data from Statcast (Baseball Savant.com) into our Rstudio file. We performed extensive data cleaning to ensure our data was able to be pushed through our machine learning models.

We then used traditional Data Preprocessing techniques by scaling the numerical data, one hot encoding categorical variables, and using train/validation/test splits our machine learning models. After creating numerous data visualizations and using testing metics like ROC AUC, precision, recall, etc. to evaluate the performance of these models, we composed a final report and presentation. After a successful presentation to the class, my group and I received both an A on the project and in the class. Unfortunately, I am unable to include our code as it was done on our university's private server, but our final presentation is included below
